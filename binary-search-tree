converting the array [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] into a Binary Search Tree:

Root is 7.
5 is to the left of the root.
1 is to the left of 5.
8 is to the right of the root.
3 is to the right of 5.
6 is to the right of 3.
0 is to the left of 1.
9 is to the right of 8.
4 is to the right of 3.
2 is to the right of 1.
As a result of these steps, the Binary Search Tree (BST) is formed as follows:


        7
       / \
      5   8
     / \   \
    1   6   9
   / \     /
  0   3   4
     / \
    2   -
